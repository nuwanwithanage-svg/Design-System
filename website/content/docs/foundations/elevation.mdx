## Overview

Elevation uses box shadows to convey depth. Use elevation purposefully — only when a component needs to appear above its surroundings.

<TokenTable tokens={[
  { name: "Shadows/sm", value: "0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)",      description: "Cards, subtle lift" },
  { name: "Shadows/md", value: "0 8px 24px -4px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)", description: "Dropdowns, popovers" },
  { name: "Shadows/lg", value: "0 6px 30px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.13)",  description: "Modals, dialogs" }
]} />

## Focus shadow

The focus ring is implemented as a `DROP_SHADOW` effect:

<TokenTable tokens={[
  { name: "focus/Ring",      value: "dark-cyan/30 (#acffef), spread: 3px, offset: 0", description: "Default focus ring" },
  { name: "focus/ringError", value: "red/30 (#ffa193), spread: 3px, offset: 0",       description: "Error state focus ring" }
]} />

## Usage guidance

| Level | Use for |
|-------|---------|
| `sm` | Cards, image thumbnails, subtle floating elements |
| `md` | Dropdowns, select menus, date pickers, tooltips |
| `lg` | Modals, side sheets, dialogs |

<Callout type="info" title="Dark mode shadows">
Shadows appear at reduced opacity in dark mode. Increase shadow spread slightly or use border + shadow combos for better visibility.
