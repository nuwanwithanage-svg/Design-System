## Component library

Components are built on semantic tokens and follow the design principles of accessibility-first, composable architecture.

| Component | Status | Variants |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Button | Stable | 576 variants (4 types × 3 sizes × 6 states × 4 icons × 2 widths) |
| Input | Stable | 36 variants (2 sizes × 6 states × 3 affix) |
| Textarea | Stable | 12 variants (2 sizes × 6 states) |

## Design principles for components

Every component in this system follows these rules:

1. **Uses semantic tokens only** — no hardcoded hex values or pixel dimensions
2. **Covers all interactive states** — default, hover, focus, error, disabled
3. **Keyboard accessible** — full navigation without a mouse
4. **Documented with examples** — usage, anatomy, do/don't

## Accessing components in Figma

All components are available in the Design System Figma file.

Use **Components panel** (Shift+I) to browse and insert components. Swap variants using the **Variant picker** in the Design panel on the right.

<Callout type="info" title="Token binding">
All component fills, strokes, corner radii, padding, and gaps are bound to Figma variables. Switching themes will update all components automatically.
