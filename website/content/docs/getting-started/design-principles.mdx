## Our principles

These principles guide every decision — from token naming to component API design.

### 1. Clarity over cleverness

Every component, token name, and pattern should be immediately understandable. Avoid abbreviations, obscure naming, or "magic" behavior that requires documentation to understand.

### 2. Accessible by default

Accessibility is not an afterthought. Every component ships with:

- Semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus-visible rings
- ARIA attributes where required
- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum)

### 3. Token-driven consistency

No hardcoded values. Every color, spacing value, radius, or shadow must reference a token. This ensures changes propagate correctly system-wide.

<Callout type="warning" title="Avoid hardcoding">
Never write `color: #2dd4bf` in component code. Always use `var(--color-background-brand-primary)` or the equivalent token reference.
</Callout>

### 4. Composition over configuration

Prefer composing simple components over adding complexity to a single component. A `Button` with an icon is better built by composing `Button` + `Icon` than by adding an `icon` prop with complex behavior.

### 5. Progressive disclosure

Show what's needed, hide what's not. Components should work out of the box with sensible defaults, with additional props available for customization when required.

### 6. B2B context

This system is built for enterprise B2B products — information-dense, task-focused, and used for extended sessions. Design choices reflect this:

- High information density is acceptable
- Muted, calm color palette reduces fatigue
- Typography optimized for reading speed
- Minimal animation to avoid distraction
