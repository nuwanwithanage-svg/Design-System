## Contribution process

All changes to the design system follow a structured review process to maintain quality and consistency.

## 1. Propose a change

Open a GitHub issue using the appropriate template:

- **New component** — for net-new UI components
- **Token change** — for adding, modifying, or deprecating tokens
- **Bug report** — for existing component defects
- **Documentation** — for doc improvements

## 2. Design review

For new components or significant changes:

1. Create a Figma proposal in the Design System file
2. Share the frame link in your GitHub issue
3. Get sign-off from a design system maintainer

## 3. Implementation

Fork the repo and create a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/component-name
```

Follow the existing patterns:
- Use semantic tokens only (no hardcoded values)
- Add MDX documentation alongside the component
- Include all required states (default, hover, focus, error, disabled)
- Ensure keyboard accessibility

## 4. Documentation

Every component ships with documentation. Use the component template and fill in:

- Overview + when to use / not to use
- Anatomy
- Variants and states
- Accessibility notes
- Code example

## 5. Review + merge

Open a PR against `main`. A maintainer will review for:

- Token usage correctness
- Accessibility compliance
- Documentation completeness
- Visual consistency

<Callout type="success" title="Versioning">
We follow semantic versioning. Breaking changes bump the major version, new additions bump minor, fixes bump patch.
