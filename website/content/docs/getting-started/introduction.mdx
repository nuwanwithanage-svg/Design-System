## What is this design system?

This design system is a collection of design decisions, reusable components, and guidelines that help teams build consistent, accessible user interfaces at scale.

It is built on a **token-first architecture**: all visual decisions — colours, spacing, typography, radius, and elevation — are captured as named tokens before they reach any component.

## Core principles

- **Token-driven**: Every design decision is a named variable, not a hardcoded value.
- **Accessible by default**: Components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- **Composable**: Small, focused components combine into patterns.
- **B2B focused**: Designed for enterprise-grade, data-dense UIs.

## What's included

| Layer | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| **Tokens** | Primitives (raw values) + Semantic (purpose-driven aliases) |
| **Foundations** | Color, typography, spacing, radius, elevation |
| **Components** | Button, Input, Textarea (more coming) |
| **Patterns** | Forms, filtering, empty states |

## Quick start

<Callout type="info" title="Using tokens">
Always use **semantic tokens** in components — never primitive tokens directly. Semantic tokens communicate intent (`background/brand/primary`) rather than value (`dark-cyan/80`).
</Callout>

Import the Tokens Studio JSON into Figma via the Tokens Studio plugin, or reference the CSS variables generated by Style Dictionary.

```css
/* Example: using a semantic token in CSS */
.button-primary {
  background-color: var(--color-background-brand-primary);
  color: var(--color-text-inverse);
}
```

## System layers

The design system follows a strict layering model:

```
Primitives → Semantic tokens → Components → Patterns → Product
```

1. **Primitives** — Raw named values (e.g. `dark-cyan/80 = #315e59`)
2. **Semantic** — Purpose aliases (e.g. `background/brand/primary = {dark-cyan/80}`)
3. **Components** — UI building blocks that consume semantic tokens
4. **Patterns** — Composed components solving specific UX problems
5. **Product** — The final application, built from patterns
